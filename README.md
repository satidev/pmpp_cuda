# Performance analysis of CUDA programs
## Introduction
This repository contains the code for the performance analysis of CUDA programs.
The programs will be helpful to analyze the impact of various performance optimizations.

## Sources
The codes are based on the following resources:
1. [Programming Massively Parallel Processors: A Hands-on Approach](https://www.amazon.de/Programming-Massively-Parallel-Processors-Hands/dp/0323912311/ref=pd_sbs_d_sccl_1_1/258-7195709-3042700?pd_rd_w=cTR1T&content-id=amzn1.sym.3c81483b-6678-478b-bd4a-9a0aedeab67e&pf_rd_p=3c81483b-6678-478b-bd4a-9a0aedeab67e&pf_rd_r=P4MA1KQXYDWQBC54D3DR&pd_rd_wg=VFzn8&pd_rd_r=776558d3-6fd9-4bc6-84ca-5a368a8274ce&pd_rd_i=0323912311&psc=1)
    The programs based on the book are in the `pmpp` directory arranged by chapters.
